\begin{document}
\maketitle

We have made all the improvements suggested by the referee. In particular, we have

\begin{itemize}
\item added explanations on the propositions-as-types intepretation of the rule (E) on page~1.
\item added a table (Table 5 on page 9) summarizing the different notions of equality used in the paper.
\item added some explanation for the importance of the notion of equivalence of types.
\item added some comments before Lemma 2.10, which explain why the proof is so detailed.
\item rephrased the statement of Proposition 3.8  (and analogous propositions) so as to make the claim clearer.
\end{itemize}
